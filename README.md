# What is Poppins?

Poppins are real world projects that are managed to help open source **beginners** to level up their skills and increase their experience in a **mentorship** community atmosphere. Of course they have a slower development pace, but the results are real and useful and the mentor-based learning experience is the main goal.

Projects created with this porpopuse can use this badge <img src="badge-poppins.svg" alt="Poppins"> to identify them so open source beginners looking for a real world experience can find they way through.
