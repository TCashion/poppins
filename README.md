# What is Poppins?

Poppins are real world projects that are managed to help open source **beginners** to level up their skills and increase their experience in a **mentorship** community atmosphere. Those projects have slower development pace than traditional open source projects, but the software built is real and the mentor-based learning approach guides all the decisions and interactions made through all the process.

Projects created with this porpopuse can use this badge <img src="badge-poppins.svg" alt="Poppins"> to identify them so open source beginners looking for a real world experience can find they way through.
