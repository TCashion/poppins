## What is Poppins?

Poppins is a kind of project managed to help open source **beginners** to level up their skills and increase their experience in a **mentorship** community atmosphere. Poppins projects have a slower development pace and are not focused on making the best software out there, instead it aims to help beginners make their first contributions following a mentor-based learning approach, covering the main aspects of how to build a good OSS in a healthy community.

Projects created with this purpose may use the Poppins badge <img src="badge-poppins.svg" alt="Poppins"> to identify them as a good place for beginners to make their first contributions and learn how the OSS development works for real.

**To build a Poppins project**, follow the [Manifesto Principles and Guidelines](MANIFESTO.md) and have fun. =)
