# The Poppins Manifesto

Whether you are building a Open Source program in your company or starting your own way on the OSS world, you may notice that it's no that easy to find projects and communities that are focused on mentoring and guiding beginners and "non-natives" on this journey. Open Source is beautiful, but when you are someone with a heavy background on corporate software development or individual freelancing that does all your stuff alone, there's a tough path until you become an effectivelly OSS contributor. Part of this learning path is definitely getting real work done. But how to find real work for beginners in OSS? There are some tips and resources out there and Poppins is one of these.

## What is Poppins?

Poppins is a kind of project managed to help open source **beginners** to level up their skills and increase their experience in a **mentorship** community atmosphere. Poppins projects have a slower development pace and are not focused on making the best software out there, instead it aims to help beginners make their first contributions following a mentor-based learning approach, covering the main aspects of how to build a good OSS in a healthy community.

Projects created with this porpopuse may use the Poppins badge <img src="badge-poppins.svg" alt="Poppins"> to identify them as a good place for beginners to make their first contributions and learn how the OSS development works for real.

## Why Poppins?

Part of the OSS mentoring journey is based on courses, readings and tutorials on how to use Git, GitHub, good practices in open source communities, why OSS is a hot thing in the IT industry and so on. After understanding and learning all this stuff you will face the challenge of making your first contribution. Whether you already know the project you want to contribute or not, you can find lots of resources in the Internet on how to find "Good First Issues". Some of them are outadated, but others are automated resources, like the [GitHub good first issues feature](https://github.blog/2020-01-22-how-we-built-good-first-issues/). But those good first issues resources **can be a step too big in your onboarding** process and maybe it would be smoother if you could contribute on projects that are **"good first projects"** before going to the good first issues.
